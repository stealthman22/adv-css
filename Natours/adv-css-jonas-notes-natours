Advanced Css by Jonas Schemdtmann

Lecture 1: What we shall learn;

Performing a basic reset with the universal selector
Setting up project-wide font definitions.
Clipping parts of elements using clip-path.

border box means change the box model, so borders and padding aren't added to height and width we specify for a box. For example: width: 200px; will give you exactly 200px wide box, borders and padding will only add to the width.

Properties related to fonts are always inherited.

You can have more than one background img in css, simply use comma in order of preference.
When adding a linear gradient as background image, we can add the direction :
background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #7ed56f, #28b485),
url(../assets/hero.jpg);
Clipping helps us create amazing shapes, using the clip path

Lesson 2 : What we whall learn:
The Easiest way to center anything with the transform properties.

For images, it is a good practice to place the image in a container, and then position that container exaclty where we want the image to be.

The span elements is perfect for styling some texts differently within the same element.
